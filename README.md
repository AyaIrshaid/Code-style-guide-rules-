Set the code style rules for the whole team to use, using `SwiftLint`.

## Using:
**SwiftLint**: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint

## Steps:
**1.** Install the library:

```

* Select the project -> Target -> Build Phases
* Click on (+) button -> New Run Script Phase
* Add the following text:
> Note that script is different based on the way of installation, check the link above.
```
"${PODS_ROOT}/SwiftLint/swiftlint"
```
